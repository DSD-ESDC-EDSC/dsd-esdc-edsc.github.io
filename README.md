# _Open Projects at the Data Science Division of ESDC_
_Open Source. Open Data. Open Collaboration._

The Data Science Division at ESDC (Chief Data Office) takes on projects related to leveraging advanced analytical techniques as well as exploring various tools and inovative ideas. Many of these projects involve the development of code and applications. Wherever possible, the ideas of an Open Project are followed.

## What is an Open Project?
An Open Project is defined here as a project that is executed using open source tools, open code, open data, and open development for the purpose of facilitating sharing and collaboration. In this light, for projects of an unsensitive nature that do not relate to protected data, the Data Science Team endeavours to share work on their Team GitHub page. While details vary from project to project, this generally means that project artifacts such as code, documentation, and more is openly available.

## Why open source?
Duplication of work is inefficient. Inevitably, work tends to get duplicated when it is not shared. Through open sourcing projects, the hope is that this will reduce duplication of work by making our progress on these projects transparent.

Additionally, we open source encourages open collaboration. The most important thing is that projects get completed and add value. Working in the open allows for others to easily add to what already exists, effectively distributing development costs and improving the probability of success for all.

## What does this mean?
The section below describes each of the Data Science Team's open projects and provides links to their Github pages, which contain further information. Please reuse any or all components of these projects - see specific open licenses for details.

## Current Open Projects

### Dynamic Org Chart
The Dynamic Org Chart (DOC) project aims to create an interactive org chart and employee directory for the Government of Canada based on open GEDS data. Visit the repo for [DOC](https://dsd-esdc-edsc.github.io/dynamic-org-chart/) to learn more about this project.
