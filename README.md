# Open Projects from the Data Science Team of ESDC
***Open Source. Open Data. Open Collaboration

## What is an Open Project?
An Open Project is defined here as a project that, wherever possible, is executed using open source tools, open code, open data, and open development for the purpose of facilitating sharing and collaboration. In this light, for projects of an unsensitive nature and that do not relate to protected data, the Data Science Team endevours to share the work on their Team GitHub page. While details vary from project to project, this generally means that project artifacts such as code, documentation, and more will be made available through GitHub.

## Why Open Source?
Duplication of work is inefficient. Inevidably, work tends to get duplicated when it is not shared. By open sourcing projects, the hope is that this will reduce duplication of work by making our progress on these projects transparent.

Additionally, we want to encourage open collaboration. The most important thing is that projects get completed and add value. Working in the open allows for others to easily add to what already exists, effectively disributing development costs and improving the probability of success for all.

## What does this mean?
The links below bring you to each of the Data Science Team's open projects and to their Github pages, which contain further information. Please reuse any/all of the components of these projects - see specific open licenses for details.
